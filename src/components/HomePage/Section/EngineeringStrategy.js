        2020 Recap: The role of technology in business strategy has never been
        more critical. With technology disrupting all areas of business, 2020
        proved that it is more critical than ever to have technology inform
        business decisions. If formulated and executed correctly, this enables
        companies to have a more agile and nimble approach to corporate
        strategy. As technology advances at a pace more rapid than ever before,
        2020 showed that these changes will need to be brought about quickly.
        For example, tech strategy can be constrained by corporate strategy. In
        such a scenario, because corporate strategy is considered to be of
        greater importance, technological development or adoption can fall by
        the wayside. To avoid this, it’s necessary for corporate and technology
        strategy to go hand in hand, and for corporate technology leaders to
        feel empowered to make such decisions.

        2021 Outlook: In a Deloitte survey, 40% of CEOs believed that the CIO
        would be the driver of business strategy. This is clear evidence that as
        strategy and technology become inextricably intertwined, technology must
        inform strategic intentions and vice versa. To do this, many decision
        makers are investing in tech-enabled strategy. This means that not only
        are the corporate strategies themselves becoming informed by technology,
        but the process of developing, executing, and monitoring strategies is
        also becoming more technologically-enabled. This means leveraging
        tech-enabled strategy platforms and tools that allow decision makers to
        think about a wider range of variables. These include futuristic
        trend-sensing technologies that scan the environment to collect and
        analyze factors that have an impact on overall strategy. This includes
        changes in the external environment, such as transforming social, legal,
        and political regulations. Changes in the industry, customer
        expectations, and stakeholder thought process will also be considered.
        Other types of technology helps leaders to simulate and test the results
        of choosing a particular strategic path to manage critical
        uncertainties. This helps to create alternate scenarios to identify and
        mitigate risks and threats. Finally, monitoring and analytics tools
        track outcomes to inform current and future strategic discussions about
        the organization's performance against the defined strategy. With these
        tools, stakeholders can assess the strategy’s impact, what is working
        well, and what needs to be changed. In 2021, all this will be done while
        pursuing alliances and ecosystem partnerships with leading
        organizations. As the world becomes more collaborative and
        hyperconnected, these alliances will go a long way in maintaining a
        unique competitive advantage.
