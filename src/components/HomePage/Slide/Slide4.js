          We think the winning companies will be those that not only embrace
          fintech-driven business models but figure out how to navigate wider
          and more crowded lanes with approaches that make the most of FS and
          TMTâ€™s combined strengths. This report will explore the current fintech
          landscape, the factors that will determine the likely winners and
          losers in coming years, and the steps that organisations can take to
          put themselves in the best position to lead.
